* Get the uf2 circuitpython bundle from circutipython website

* Load onto feather
** Plug in usb-c
** Then double click reset button
** Wokred on win, mounted as RPi-Rp or something
*** On linux, did not auto load
*** Maybe manual mount and then proceed?
*** I did not actually run fdisk on the bare board, so maybe it wiil work
** Copy the uf2 bundle to the feahter. It shoudl then show up as CIRCUITPY in devices
   

* Install mu editor 
** pip3 install mu-edi... something.
** To run on non-root, go into admin and add tty to user priv
** NOTE... started to launch in root before thinking better/aborting. Possible that is what resolved
 
* Projects
** So far RTC via adafruit
*** Need to put req libraires onto the feather.  
*** The full bundle is in CiryPY repo (ig), only copied over the 3 needed for RTC
*** Via mu, copy paste RTC program worked.
**** Then swtiched flag to true, set time, disconnected, seemed to track time.  Yay!
**** For that I think the next change initiates a rerun. So 
***** Set clock with True, actual time
***** Let it run however long on serial to monitor. 
***** Then edit file to False, no need to adjust time
***** It will then keep printing to serial but not reset clock time
***** Sort of makes sense
 
** Soil serial
*** Bum sensor! Would have worked right away but one of the ones won't read, other 2 are fine
*** DONE Headers onto screen, then can play with SD card, RTC, screen, combined prog to dispaly and write

** Confusing though
*** do all progs need to be named code.py?
**** NO- Code.py can just import whatever the meanifully names script actaully is.
*** Emacs edit on device vs local and copy?
**** YES- Either dired /run/media/joel/CircuitPy/
*** Guessing makes sense to ... use meaingful names local, 
*** THEN save as /code.py on device to run
*** In that case, can run standard git repo for code.
